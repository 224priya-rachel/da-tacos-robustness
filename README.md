This is a MS-level research project where an analysis is done on how cover song identification algorithms behave under real-world audio distortions using the Da-TACOS benchmark.
*Due to copyright restrictions, audio files are not included, useres must supply their own Da-TACOS cover audio following the documented folder structure.*
